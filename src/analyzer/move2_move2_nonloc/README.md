R move2 non-locations

The move2_nonloc IO type is for working with non-location data like acceleration or other accessory measurements. Note that move2 objects can contain location as well as non-location data. This IO type has been limited to work with non-location data only, to keep the system separate for location and non-location data that can generically only be analysed separately. Apps to combine the two IO types are planned for 2024.
