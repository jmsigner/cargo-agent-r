R CTMM Telemetry List

This IO type is to work with the R ctmm package, that requires telmetry objects as input. Generically the data type "telemetry" contains data of only one track/animal. To keep things compatible with moveStacks/move2 objects of multiple tracks/animals, this IO type has been designed to be a list of telemetry objects.
