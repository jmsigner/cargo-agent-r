R move2 locations

The R move2 package has been designed to replace the R move package, because dependencies of the latter one will become deprecated at the end of 2023. The move2_loc IO type is meant to replace the moveStack. Note that move2 objects can contain location as well as non-location data. This IO type has been limited to work with location data only, to keep the system separate for location and non-location data that can generically only be analysed separately. Apps to combine the two IO types are planned for 2024.
